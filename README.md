## Setup

Download the latest [release](https://github.com/Rystal-Team/Rystal-V6/releases/latest)
from [Releases](https://github.com/Rystal-Team/Rystal-V6/releases).

To run the bot you simply have to install requirements in `requirements.txt`
with `pip install -r <path-to>/requirements.txt`.<br>
**With containers such as pterodactyl, there might be issue with installing `setuptools` as it's already included. If
this is the case please use `container-requirements.txt` or remove `setuptools` from `requirement.txt` instead.*

The main config file is `.env`, make a copy of `.env.example` and rename it into `.env` and enter the required
tokens.<br>
Customisations for the bot can be found in `config/example.config.yaml`, make a copy of it and rename it
to `config.yaml` to continue.
